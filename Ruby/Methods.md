# Methods
```ruby
def method_name
  1 + 1
end
```
## Naming
- The bang methods(! at the end of method name) are called and executed just like any other method. However, by convention, a method with an exclamation point or bang permanently modifies its receiver
- Methods that end with a question mark by convention return boolean
- Methods that end with an equals sign indicate an assignment method. For assignment methods the return value is ignored, the arguments are returned instead
